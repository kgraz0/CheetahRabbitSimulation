## Title

This is the first version of the Cheetah and Rabbit game that I developed individually as part of my assignment for University.

## Installation

Download the files, compile Menu.java and run Menu.java to start. Follow instructions on screen after that. Make sure that the environment you are using supports user input (such as CMD) and GUIs.

## How it works

The game simulates two automated players, Cheetah and Rabbit, on a 2D grid where they are both able to move Up, Down, Left, Right or diagonally. There is a border set to make sure that neither of them go out of bounds. They both move in random directions until the Cheetah eventually catches the Rabbit by both ending up on the same tile. If the user decides to select the second option in the menu, they are able to specify the length of walk (amount of moves) and the spawning location (X and Y) of the cheetah. In this mode, the movement of Cheetah is recorded and saved into the SavedWalks.txt file.
